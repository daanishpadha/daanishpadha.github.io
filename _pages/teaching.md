## Selected Comments from Students

give my mans Daanish a tenure! Skip the years of professorship, Daanish is ready to teach full lecture halls of young economic majors of the future. Great lecturer, at times more informative and clear than the professor himself. Wonderful young man and a life save in this course. I wish he would have shown us his pets! I hear them barking occasionally in the background :-)

A very kind and fair TA, I wish him the best and I'm very grateful for having him this quarter

He is a good teacher. In fact, he is better than the professor at explaining the lecture and solving the problems. He basically taught me everything. Everything I learned in this course was because of Daanish.

Great TA. He was always organzied and helpful.

An amazing TAwho did everything he could to help the students. 10/10.

Very good at answering all our questions.

Great expierence. 

The TA explained the homework problem well and it was easy to understand. I thought it was great because I was able to know what my mistake was.

Overall a good learning experience, keep doing the same thing!

Daanish went out of his way to help us as students and provided great information when it came to exams. I felt that I had a pretty good grasp on the concepts we learned in class but wherever I fell short Daanish was able to fill in the bubbles for me!

Daanish is knowledgeable about the topics that we study and is always available/accessible for his students

I enjoyed the class! 

discussion section is engaging, explanation is relevant to the homework and prepared students for the quizzes and exams

Daanish Padha was a great TA to have this quarter. Office hours were very accessible, assignments were graded quickly, the content was organized, and I had no trouble finding/answering discussion questions during this course whatsoever. I recommend this instructor very much.

Overall, Daanish is a good teacher for the discussions. Daanish outlines the plans for each discussion, and also gives insight into questions that students may have.

Daanish is a very cool guy. He is very straightforward which is something I prefer. He is very good at explaining concepts that can be quite difficult to understand. Awesome guy!

Daanish was a great TA. He was always available and clarified any questions I had.

Really great teacher and wanted to help us as much as possible. Very quiet classroom, but he dealt with it well.

Really enjoyed my time in Daanish's class. He was very helpful with assignments and easy to get a hold of.

Mr. Daanish did a great job at teaching in the course, and was overrall really effective at helping me understand the content.

He is very knowledgeable and knows how to teach.


I really appreciated how available Mr. Padha was. Despite having certain office hours, he was always available via Zoom when I needed it!

TA Daanish seemed to understand the material thoroughly and went through the practice problems in each discussion section.

It's because of Daanish that I knew what to do. He is a really good teacher, and shows you different approaches to the same problem. He even help you find easier ways to memorize formulas and applying them correctly. Overall great teacher

I truly appreciate his patience in helping me learn. He took his time in the day to have an extra office hour. Thank you for this summer session!

Daanish thank you for your guidance and instruction throughout this quarter!
